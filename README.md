== README

This is a Kanban Board App aimed at helping people to create tasks and follow the progress status of the tasks.

Still in relatively early stages of development (this line will be edited to reflect the development level).

Still tests to be done (coming!).

A deployed version of a current version should be available at kanbanist.herokuapp.com.

To install:
- bundle install

Note1: the app was built using Postgres as a development database. Config/database.yml needs to be edited accordingly if another 
database is to be used.

Note2: Creation of user pages is mimicked after Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial available at http://www.railstutorial.org/
